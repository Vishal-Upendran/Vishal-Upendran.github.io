The ASI meeting at IIT Roorkee was coming to a close, with some amazing talks & posters, and great interactions with new people. The stage was getting set for folks to go back to their homes and start working. But I had a very different idea.

Roorkee, and [Haridwar some distance away]({{site.url}}/travel/2022/03/27/emerging-from-the-pandemic.html) form the start of a general pilgrimage tour for the hindus called the "Chota char dham yatra", or the smaller tour of four holy sites. The four holy sites are four mountain peaks in the Himalayas adorned with beautiful temples and marking the start of beautiful rivers -- Badrinath (or Badrikashrama, where Alakananda starts), Kedarnath (where Mandakini starts), Gangotri (where Bhagirathi starts) and Yamunotri (where Yamuna starts). Ever since the ASI announced of the conference at Roorkee, I wanted to perform this small tour. However, I didn't have enough time -- we have got work to do -- so I wanted to atleast visit Badrinath, where the God Badri Vishal (yep, I am named after this God) resides. The temple is flanked by two mountains named Nara and Narayana, which get completely covered with snow during the winters, preventing any travel to the temple.

I thought "summer" would mean "after Equinox", so the temple would be open. But to my dismay, I found out that all the four temples would actually open more than a month later. I was very much heartbroken at the foil of my plans. Nevertheless, I planned to go till the closest possible base camp -- called Joshimath. Joshimath is named after a monastry established by the great Adi Shankaracharya, who revised, cleaned and revived Hinduism in the 5th century or so. He is credited with establishing the philosophy of Advaita, commentaries on texts like Bhagavad Gita, and composition of poems like Bhaja Govindam. Shankaracharya established the monastry at Joshimath, and is then said to have trekked to Badrinath. During the winter months where one cannot travel to the mountain, the prayers may be performed at the temple in Joshimath. So at the very least, I could visit the various sites within Joshimath, if not go to Badri. I coerced a trekker-philosopher-gravitational wave researcher friend of mine named Anuj from IUCAA into joining me for this journey -- it would be difficult to go alone!

On the final day of ASI, a friend of ours asked us for our plans. Bikram - a very much free spirited adventurer who studies stuff that occurs inside neutron stars - had no return tickets booked. He was going with the flow, and since he had no plans, he wanted to join us. Well, more the merrier, and 3 is a nice group to manage! So the three of us had the following plan:

1. Wake up early and go to Haridwar or Rishikesh.
2. Figure out a way to either go to Joshimath or get down somewhere on the way.
3. If possible stay the night at Rudraprayag. 

I was going insane figuring out how to go to Joshimath, since most people were giving us very pessimistic opinion on the transport to this town. But I knew this: the river Alakananda merges with 5 rivers as it comes down to the plains from Badrinath. The fifth and final river is the Bhagirathi, and their confluence is called Devaprayag (prayag literally means confluence). The mixed Bhagirathi-Alakananda then become what we know as Ganga, so I basically wanted to trace Ganga back to her nascent stages. And so, I wanted to start from Devaprayag. 

We woke up at 4 a.m and got ready to look for a bus to Haridwar. Unfortunately, no bus turned up, so we took a shared auto for the same cost. As we were getting down at Haridwar, we heard a guy shouting "Joshimath.... Joshimath"! Apparently, a bus was leaving for Joshimath at that instant! We hopped onto it, and took tickets for our first stop -- Devaprayag!

## Devaprayag

The route to Devaprayag was terribly beautiful. Intially we coasted through Rishikesh, and then entered the winding mountain roads. These roads were super nice -- almost two-lane highways. But the twists and turns were horrible. I thought I would throw up -- many people did -- but luckily I had taken just one glass of tea since morning, so nothing can come out! We stopped at a place for breakfast, and the view from the balcony just blew my mind off:

Some piping hot maggie and tea were the perfect breakfast I needed. As we kept moving along those winding roads, the beautiful confluence came to our view:

The driver finally dropped us off at the first confluence -- Devaprayag. All of us were feeling too sick due to the ride. A lemon soda was the perfect pick-me-up I needed, and I sat down chatting with the old man who ran the stall. Having extended conversations, offering advice and helping our random strangers seems to be in the very culture of the folks there, and I absolutely loved it. We thanked the _uncle_, and made our way to witness the confluence, or _sangam_.

With our numerous bags, we walked down, crossing a narrow bridge across the river Bhagirathi. As we walked down the numerous shops of ornaments, pooja items, and sweet/snacks, we finally made our way to a lookout point from which we got our view of the sangam -- and it was majestic. Here, have a look:

The blue coloured river is the Bhagirathi, while the brown one is Alakananda. As they meet, they don't merge immediately. Rather, they slosh against each other, forming small vortex-like features which remind us of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabililty. Then, some many hundred meters down, they finally unite to give rise to the might Ganga.

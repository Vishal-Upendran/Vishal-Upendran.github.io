I am a graduate student at Inter University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India, holding the position of 'Senior Research Fellow' (2 year done last July!). I did my undergraduation/graduation (a 5 year course) from Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT Madras), India.

Over the course of last couple of years, I have been trying to understand the regions of the Sun which give rise to the solar wind, and the possible acceleration locations/mechanism of the solar wind. I use Machine learning and numerical Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic simulations, along with solar observations for this study. Allied to this, I also study the possible mechanisms which keep the solar corona hot -- a.k.a, the "Coronal Heating problem".

In general, I like automating things around me, and reduce human workload so efficient research could be done (I am still learning, but who is not!). Some of my codes on GitHub can be found here, where I also document certain computational assignments given to us as a part of the graduate school. Eventually, all of my research codes will go up there!

This website is meant to be a collection of professional projects, a curated set of papers, books, courses which I think might be of interest to the general public, and a bunch of tutorials/ talks. A more personal blog/travelogue can be found [on wordpress](https://vishalupendran.wordpress.com/), and a bunch of semi-technical articles aimed for the informed reader on [medium](https://medium.com/@uvishal1995).

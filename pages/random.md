### IUCAA Summer school 2021

In the first week of June 2021, I gave a set of two lectures to the students of IUCAA Summer School and the Teacher's Refresher course. These were two - lectures of one and half hour each providing an Introduction to python for astronomy, and an Introduction to Machine learning. These two lectures may be found on Youtube: [![Intro to python]({{site.url}}/img/yticon.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBQMu6qb60U&t=4174s) and [![Machine learning]({{site.url}}/img/yticon.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELztHo6qtjw). 

For folks who don't want to see an ~1.5 hour video, the tutorial is put up as a set of pages here: [Intro to python]({% post_url 2021-06-01-python_intro %}) and [Machine learning]({% post_url 2021-06-02-Regression %})

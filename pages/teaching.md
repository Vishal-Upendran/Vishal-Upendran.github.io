### GEM Summer 2022 Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics

I was invited to give a 15-minute tutorial on using Spherical harmonics to fit data. I have written up a notebook on:
1. Using Lasso as a sparse fitting method to recover Fourier coefficients of a 1-D array.
2. Using Lasso as a sparse fitting method to recover the Spherical harmonic coefficients of a 2-D field.
3. Performing cross validation to fix the hyperparameters.

The tutorial is made available [here]({% post_url 2022-05-24-GEM_tutorial_Vishal.slides %})  , but if you want to just go online and work on the notebook, you can open it in Colab here: [https://gist.github.com/Vishal-Upendran/8b5b7b5bea62c27f6a7426a6228cdb25](https://gist.github.com/Vishal-Upendran/8b5b7b5bea62c27f6a7426a6228cdb25). 

### IUCAA Summer school 2021

In the first week of June 2021, I gave a set of two lectures to the students of IUCAA Summer School and the Teacher's Refresher course. These were two - lectures of one and half hour each providing an Introduction to python for astronomy, and an Introduction to Machine learning. These two lectures may be found on Youtube:<br>

For folks who don't want to see an ~1.5 hour video, the tutorial is put up as a set of pages here: [Intro to python]({% post_url 2021-06-01-python_intro %}) and [Machine learning]({% post_url 2021-06-02-Regression %})

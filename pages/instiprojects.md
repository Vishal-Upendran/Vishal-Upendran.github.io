Hello there!

I have substantial work over my tenure of 5 years at IIT Madras. 

Many of the IIT Madras projects were done during coursework, some at an external organization, and some as a part of the [Center for Innovation](http://cfi.iitm.ac.in/wordpress/)- an alumni funded-student run organization which has the motto: "Walk in with an idea, walk out with a product".

I shall provide a brief overview of each work below, and the same could be accessed in detail by clicking on the tabs on top.

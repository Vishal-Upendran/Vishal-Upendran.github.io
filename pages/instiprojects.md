Hello there!

I have substantial work over my tenure of 5 years at IIT Madras. 

Many of the IIT Madras projects were done during coursework, some at an external organization, and some as a part of the [Center for Innovation](http://cfi.iitm.ac.in/wordpress/)- an alumni funded-student run organization which has the motto: "Walk in with an idea, walk out with a product".

### Light curve classiﬁcation using Deep learning methods

>Supervisor(s): Independent project with sophomores at Physics and Astronomy club, IIT Madras.

Overview:

Developed a deep classiﬁer for detection and classiﬁcation of Kepler light curves for Exoplanet detection using Kaggle exoplanet dataset.
Automated the process of extraction and classiﬁcation of over 1000 light curves, improving accessibility of light curves for research.

### Realistic muscle model for real-time neuromorphic actuation

>Supervisor(s): Dr. Jorg Conradt, Dr. Christoph Richter, Neuroscientiﬁc System theory, TU Munich

Overview:

 Project done as a part of DAAD-WISE program 2016. Mathematically modeled muscles to emulate them in Intelligent Robots, and library for controller created to enable existing intelligent robotics setup generate a muscle-inspired adaptive response.
To be incorporated in the Human Brain project as the control and actuation mechanism of myomorphic hardware.

### Refreshable Braille Monitor

>Supervisor(s): Dr. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay (IIT Madras)

Overview:

 Developed a single cell Braille monitor with a novel actuation mechanism using Shape memory alloys to optimize performance and heat generation.
Led a team of 5 students in managing budget and materials, while performing mathematical optimization and electronic design of the product.
Manufactured the product at less than 50% of the market price, thus potentially making it aﬀordable to public.

### Radio Telescope and SWAN array

>Supervisor(s): Done independently along with students of Physics and Astronomy club, IIT Madras; now in a colaboration with Prof. Desh at RRI.

Overview:

 Mentored the construction and application of a 2m prototype Radio prototype at IIT Madras, thereby collaborating with Raman Research Institute- Bangalore for stage-2 by partaking in SWAN radio array.
Currently mentoring the students in data acquisition and image processing of a Murchison Wideﬁeld Array as a part of SWAN radio array stage-2.
Enhanced participation in Radio astronomy by 150%, leading to establishment of Radio astronomy wing of IIT Madras.

### Body Impedance Analyser

>Supervisor(s): Preejith SP., Healthcare and Technology Innovation Center, Research park, IIT Madras.

Overview:

Performed extensive literature survey, and prototyped a model for Body impedance analyser with fail-safe mechanisms and safety measures.
Prototype to be incorporated in Vitalsens, a low cost next generation healthcare monitoring platform from HTIC.

### Study of Cross ﬁngering scheme for a Six-hole transverse ﬂute

>Supervisor(s): Prof. Savio Sebastian, IIT Madras

Overview:

Studied and simulated a 6-hole baroque ﬂute using existing physical models and validated using real data.
Studied the end corrections and barrel eﬀects, with real world validation, and understood the cross ﬁngering scheme for altered notes.
Project done as a part of the course Science of Musical instruments at Dept. of Engineering design, IIT Madras.

I felt it is redundant to have a separate page dedicated for certain projects, when it is explained well in the project report. The project report can be found here: Cross fingering scheme_flute

### Development of a game of Quantum chess

>Supervisor(s): Done as a part of Physics and Astronomy club, IIT Madras.

Overview:

Mentored the development of a game of Quantum chess, based on the concept of Quantum games, to enable enhanced outreach of Quantum mechanics to the common people.
Exhibited the game at Center for Innovation (CFI) Open house 2016 and garnered great attention from the general public, students and faculty.

The game has been uploaded on Git, and it can be found [here](https://github.com/Vishal-Upendran/Quantum-Chess).
